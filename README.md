# Note-Taking-App

## Description
This is a simple browser app for writing down and saving simple notes. I did not design the front end functionality, such as the website itself or its javascript. I was given all of that as starter code and assigned to create backend server functionality as an assignment, which I have done.

## Usage
This app allows you to create notes and save them using the save icon at the upper right. When clicked, the note slots on the left hand side of the page which lists all current existing notes, will open up whatever note you have clicked. From here, to make a new note you must press the new note icon at the top right of the page. Additionally, notes can also be deleted by pressing the red trashcan icon next to the note titles of the list on the left side of the screen. All that is necessary to use the application is to open up the deployment on railway through your browser.
